# Canadian Banks Stock Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the stock performance of major Canadian banks over a specific period. By leveraging historical stock data, we seek to identify trends, assess market volatility, and provide data-driven insights to support informed investment decisions.  
For a detailed analysis, refer to the full report: [Canadian Banks Stock Report](https://github.com/helenzhupnyk/canadian_banks_stock_data_analysis/blob/main/reports/Canadian_Banks_Stock_Report_draft1.pdf)

### Goals  
- Analyze historical stock price trends for major Canadian banks.  
- Assess market volatility and its impact on stock performance.  
- Identify correlations between stock price movements and external factors.  
- Develop predictive models to forecast future stock prices.  
- Present insights through interactive dashboards and reports.  

### Business Questions  
- What are the key trends in Canadian bank stock performance?  
- How volatile have these stocks been over time?  
- Can we predict future stock performance based on historical data?  
- How do different banks compare in terms of stability and returns?  

By answering these questions, we aim to provide actionable insights for investors and analysts.

## Data Collection  

The dataset comprises historical stock prices for major Canadian banks, sourced through web scraping from [Yahoo Finance](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/). The data includes stock prices from January 2020 to December 2024, capturing daily closing prices, trading volumes, and other key metrics.  

### Data Source  
Web scraping was used to efficiently and automatically extract stock data, ensuring an up-to-date and comprehensive dataset. The dataset covers the following banks:  

- **[Bank of Montreal (BMO)](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMO.TO/history)**  
- **[Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNS.TO/history)**  
- **[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM)](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/CM.TO/history)**  
- **[Royal Bank of Canada (RY)](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/RY.TO/history)**  
- **[Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/TD.TO/history)**  

### Data Structure  
The dataset consists of the following columns:  

- **`stock_ticker`** â€“ Bank stock symbol (e.g., BMO.TO, TD.TO)  
- **`date`** â€“ Trading date  
- **`close_price`**, **`high_price`**, **`low_price`**, **`open_price`** â€“ Daily stock prices  
- **`volume`** â€“ Number of shares traded  

These variables are essential for understanding price trends and trading activity.  

## Findings & Insights  

Our analysis of Canadian bank stocks provides valuable insights into their performance, volatility, and predictive trends. The key findings are based on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **Monte Carlo simulations**, **ARIMA forecasting**, and interactive **dashboard visualizations**.  

### 1. Stock Performance Trends  
- All five banksâ€”**BMO, BNS, CM, RY, and TD**â€”demonstrated **steady growth** over the analyzed period.  
- **RBC (RY) and TD Bank (TD)** showed the most consistent upward trends, making them relatively stable investments.  

### 2. Volatility Assessment  
- While all banks experienced **periods of volatility**, **CIBC (CM)** exhibited the highest fluctuations, suggesting higher risk but potential for short-term gains.  
- **BMO and RBC stocks** showed more resilience to market shocks, making them suitable for risk-averse investors.  
- **Monte Carlo simulations** highlighted the range of possible future stock prices, emphasizing the uncertainty in short-term predictions.  

### 3. Correlation Analysis  
- A **strong positive correlation** was observed between the stock prices of all five banks.  
- This suggests that external macroeconomic factorsâ€”such as **interest rates, inflation, and financial sector performance**â€”affect all banks similarly.  
- **Diversification within Canadian bank stocks may not significantly reduce risk** since they move in tandem.  

### 4. Predictive Modeling & Forecasting  
- **ARIMA models** provided reasonable short-term predictions, with RBC and TD showing the **most predictable trends**.  
- **Monte Carlo simulations** demonstrated a range of possible future prices, helping assess potential risks.  
- Future stock performance is **highly dependent on economic conditions**, making continuous monitoring essential.  

### 5. Interactive Dashboard Insights  
- Our **Power BI dashboard** presents real-time trends, moving averages, and volatility indicators for each bank.  
- Users can filter by **date range, stock ticker, and performance metrics** to gain personalized insights.  
- A comparison of **historical vs. predicted prices** helps assess model accuracy and investment potential.

These findings provide **actionable insights** for investors, helping them assess risk, identify trends, and make informed investment decisions. ðŸš€  

## Recommendations

- **Diversification**: Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to mitigate risks associated with sector-specific downturns.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Given the observed volatility, regular monitoring of stock performance is advisable to make timely investment decisions.
- **Further Research**: Additional analysis incorporating macroeconomic indicators could provide deeper insights into factors influencing stock performance.

## Future Enhancements

To build upon this analysis, the following improvements are proposed:

- **Incorporate Dividend Analysis**: Evaluating dividend yields and payout ratios to assess the total return on investment.
- **Expand Dataset**: Including more financial institutions or extending the time frame for a more comprehensive analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing machine learning models to forecast future stock performance based on historical data.

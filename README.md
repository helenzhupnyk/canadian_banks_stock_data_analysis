## Key Findings

1. **Stock Performance Trends**: Analysis revealed that all five banks experienced growth in their stock prices over the analyzed period, with notable fluctuations corresponding to major economic events.
2. **Volatility Assessment**: The banks exhibited varying levels of volatility, with some showing more resilience to market downturns than others.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: There is a high positive correlation among the stock prices of these banks, indicating that they often move in tandem, likely due to their exposure to similar market conditions.

## Recommendations

- **Diversification**: Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to mitigate risks associated with sector-specific downturns.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Given the observed volatility, regular monitoring of stock performance is advisable to make timely investment decisions.
- **Further Research**: Additional analysis incorporating macroeconomic indicators could provide deeper insights into factors influencing stock performance.

## Future Enhancements

To build upon this analysis, the following improvements are proposed:

- **Incorporate Dividend Analysis**: Evaluating dividend yields and payout ratios to assess the total return on investment.
- **Expand Dataset**: Including more financial institutions or extending the time frame for a more comprehensive analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing machine learning models to forecast future stock performance based on historical data.
